# Deaf preventer

I will create a system that will measure and detect the decibale level in that room and when it is over a certain range 
the waring system will active telling you through the flashing led, buzzer and OLED sceen that the decibles are too loud
and you are at risk of hearing damage.
Decibalms will be measured through the sound detecter

### Its will be made with a sound senor that will measure the decible level
 when it goes over a certain decible for example 80 decibles which is considered a police siren or a noisy resturant
  it will activate the LED that will procced to flash, the OLED screen will light up with text saying to keep it down and the buzzer will activate.
